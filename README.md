# 👁️ Computer Vision with OpenCV – Image & Video Processing

This project focuses on building **foundational computer vision pipelines using OpenCV**, emphasizing image processing, basic visual analysis, and real-time video handling.

The goal is to understand how raw images and video frames can be programmatically transformed and analyzed as a preprocessing stage for higher-level vision tasks.

## ⚙️ Implementation Work

* **Image Loading & Display**
  Read and visualize images using OpenCV utilities.

* **Color Space Conversion**
  Converted BGR images to grayscale for simplified processing.

* **Image Resizing**
  Scaled images to fixed spatial dimensions.

* **Edge Detection**
  Applied Canny edge detection to extract object boundaries.

* **Thresholding**
  Performed binary thresholding for foreground–background separation.

* **Image Masking**
  Created masks to isolate regions of interest.

* **Geometric Transformations**
  Rotated images using affine transformation matrices.

* **Face Detection (Haar Cascade)**
  Implemented frontal face detection using pre-trained Haar Cascades.

* **Video Capture (Webcam)**
  Captured and displayed live camera frames.

* **Video File Processing**
  Read and displayed frames from video/GIF sources.

## 🔍 Explorations

* Compared original vs grayscale vs edge-detected images.
* Observed impact of threshold values on segmentation quality.
* Analyzed how geometric transformations affect spatial structure.
* Tested real-time frame acquisition from webcam.
